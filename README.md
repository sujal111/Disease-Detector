### Project Descripttion

> **Health is Wealth and is rightly said so.
The pandemic of Covid-19 has apparently stressed on the significance of healthcare in one's life. We are living and leading our life in an information driven world and harnessing the application of Technology in healthcare becomes an important factor.
Amid such situation ....

Problem Statement
Being a homosapien, human is inflicted with slew of diseases. In this hustling-bustling world, people are so busy in life that they don't have time for upgrading their health. Also unfortunate times like this, wherein people are reluctant to go to the hospitals for the scare of Covid-19. Our webApp apparently provides a portal for such people who can effectively type their symptoms and the webApp will showcase

Most Probable disease which the person might be inflicted with
It will provide the description of the disease
Prevention is better than cure and henceforth it will provide Preventive measures a well.**
